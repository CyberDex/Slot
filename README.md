[Play game](https://cyberdex.github.io/games/Slot/ "Play game")

## Project description
This was made in 2018.
It has a spin result control option as debugging functionality inside the game (look left bottom corner).

So you can drag elements to their result positions before the spin.

Also, the condition was to count results based on paytable (left top corner), so there is some math implemented.
